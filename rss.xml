            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>                                              xo,                          wanderlusting</h1><p>It's been nearly 4 months since I officially graduated from THE University of Texas. 7 if you count from when I walked across the stage at commencement. They tell us, "What starts here changes the world." They set us up to do great things, and I truly believe these possibilities are endless, but everyone values greatness differently and everyone discovers their potential at different points in their life. It's been 7 months since I finished college and I've come to the realization that I am not going to be the person who follows the beaten path. When I think of the person I want to become and the things that genuinely inspire me, I don't imagine a 9 to 5 and witty banter over happy hour or weekend getaways to a destination city. I enjoy those things as much as the next girl, but my dreams extend beyond that. I want to explore the world and experience all that it has to offer. I want to discover my passion and the thing that makes me great, and eventually, I want to inspire. I want to change the world, even if it's just for one other person. My heart has always been the driving force in every decision I've made and that has lead to both the most incredible moments and the lowest of the low, but I refuse to settle for something that I'm not completely invested in. Until I do, I'll keep looking.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/640588a80ce5130a43abc1738db53e9d3620e6c8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
